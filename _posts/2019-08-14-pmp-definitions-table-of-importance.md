I'm reading The PMP Exam: How to Pass on Your First Try by Andy Crowe.  As part of my studying, I decided to write each definition in a Google Doc condensing this further.  The goal is to have my cliff notes with book citations for further info.

I had a curious thought after finishing the last definition - how does each term apply to each process group and how can I order the terms by importance?

The 5 process groups are: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.  Each question on the exam relates to one of these groups however, not all groups have the same number of questions, therefore some kinda of natural ordering is implied.

Executing makes up 31% of the exam, followed by Monitoring & Controlling with 25%, then Planning (24%), Initiating (13%), and finally Closing (7%).

Without further ado, I present the matrix (it is a work in progress and subject to change, as all things should be).
